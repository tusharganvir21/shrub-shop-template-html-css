# shrub-shop-template-html-css
It is a part of my learning process, I made a basic template using HTML and CSS, and tried to make it more attractive.

## Description
This project is a basic HTML and CSS template for a fictional garden design firm called Lucky Shrub. The template includes a responsive design, navigation bar with animation effects, a banner image, and a glow effect on the logo. 

## Note
I've included references to images in the HTML file, but the actual image files are not part of this submission. Please add the images to their respective directories for a complete view.

## Files
- `index.html`: This HTML file is the main structure of the Lucky Shrub website, incorporating responsive design elements, a navigation bar with animation effects, and a banner image.
- `styles.css`: This CSS file contains styles for the Lucky Shrub website, including layout, responsive design, and visual effects such as glow and floating animations.

## How to Use
1. Download the `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
2. Place the files in your project directory.
3. Add the images to their respective directories as referenced in the HTML file.
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the template.
